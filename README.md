# `AngularJS SPA with UI-Router`

This project contains three main features:

- 'List' of the data displayed in the table,
- 'Details' for each item in the list opened as a child state,
- 'Edit' view which allows update any item of the list.

Client-side routing is implemented with UI-Router for AngularJs:
A client-side router updates the browser URL as the user nagivates through the single page app.

The app uses [Bootstarp](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/) for styling.

The project includes [Ui router for angularjs](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/) for client-side routing.



### Run the Application

The project is preconfigured with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
